# Face Mask Detection using CNN 😷🚀

## 📝 Description 
This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not from input images. The dataset used in this project consists of images of people with and without face masks. The CNN is trained on this data to learn the patterns of face masks and make predictions on new images.

## 📊 Dataset 
The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle. The dataset contains images of people both with and without face masks.

## 🎯 Approach 
1. Importing Dependencies: Install the required libraries and configure the Kaggle API to download the dataset.

2. Importing Face Mask Dataset: Download and extract the face mask dataset from Kaggle.

3. Creating Labels: Assign labels to the images based on whether the person is wearing a face mask or not.

4. Image Processing: Resize the images and convert them into numpy arrays.

5. Train-Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets.

6. Building a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Construct a CNN model using Keras for face mask detection.

7. Model Training: Compile and train the CNN model on the training data.

8. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the test data and visualize the training and validation loss and accuracy.

9. Predictive System: Implement a system to make predictions on new images to detect face masks.

## 📥 Installations 
To run the code, you need to install the required Python libraries. Use the following command to install the dependencies:

```
pip install kaggle opencv-python tensorflow matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## ⚙️ Setup 
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Make sure you have a Kaggle account and a Kaggle API token (kaggle.json).
3. Place the kaggle.json file in the appropriate location and set permissions.
4. Execute the "Notebook-code" to download the dataset, preprocess the data, build and train the CNN model.

## 🛠️ Requirements 
- Python 3.x
- Kaggle API Token
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn

## 🚀 Technology Used 
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Image Processing
- Kaggle API

## ▶️ Run
1. After setting up the environment and dependencies, run the "Notebook-code".
2. The script will download the dataset, preprocess the data, build the CNN model, and start the training process.
3. Once the model is trained, you can use the predictive system to make predictions on new images to detect face masks.
